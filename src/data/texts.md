# Gems of Atrani
As a town, Atrani proves size means nothing on the Amalfi Coast. Here’s where it shines.

### Square in Atrani (Piazzetta Umberto I)
**Category**: Photo Spot
**Tagline**: The authentic heart of the village

**Short info:**
Follow the green arrows through the village to discover this cinematic square. It’s the perfect spot to escape the Amalfi crowds and capture the true soul of the coast.

**The Details:**
Throughout Atrani, you'll spot signs with prominent green arrows—these are actually flood evacuation markers, but for us, they are guides to beauty. Following them leads you to the charming Piazzetta Umberto I, right in front of the San Salvatore de' Birecto church. It is intimate, enclosed by traditional houses, and serves as the living room for locals. Grab a coffee here and watch the world go by; it’s a signature sight that embodies the essence of Atrani.

### Castiglione Beach (Lido di Ravello)
**Category**: Hidden Beach
**Tagline**: Serenity between the cliffs

**Short info:**
A picturesque secret nestled between towering cliffs, just a short walk from Atrani. It requires some effort to reach, which keeps the massive crowds away.

**The Details:**
Nestled between two dramatic cliffs lies this picturesque location, just a short distance beyond the Atrani square. To reach this idyllic spot, continue down the main road towards Ravello/Minori and look for the entrance with a staircase on the right. Be prepared: it’s a descent of approximately 200 steps to reach the water. The beach receives sunlight primarily in the morning (until about 1:00 PM), so arrive early. The crystal-clear sea and the view of the church of Maddalena from below are worth every step.

### Waterfall of Atrani
**Category**: Hidden Place
**Tagline**: Place of pure nature

**Short info:**
A serene natural spot hidden just minutes from the village center. Best visited after rain, it offers a cool, green escape from the stone streets.

Here, nestled between the steep cliffs of Monte Civita and Monte Aureo, you'll find the waterfall. It is a seasonal wonder often a trickle in the high summer heat but transforming into a majestic cascade after rainfall. It’s a peaceful reminder of the nature that surrounds this ancient town.

**Tagline**: Sacret and beautiful place

**Short info:**
The Church of Santa Maria del Bando and Grotto Masaniello is a historic sanctuary on Mount Aureo in Atrani, first documented in 1187. Reaching it requires climbing 750 steps. A

**The Details:**
The Church of Santa Maria del Bando stands as a spiritually significant sanctuary nestled on the slopes of Mount Aureo in Atrani, offering a profound connection to centuries of faith and Mediterranean heritage. First documented in 1187, this medieval church represents a remarkable fusion of religious devotion and architectural history spanning nearly a millennium.
The church’s distinctive name “Bando” derives from historical proclamations announced from this sacred location during the Maritime Republics era. Central to its spiritual significance is a powerful legend: an unjustly condemned man was miraculously spared through the Virgin Mary’s intercession, a story beautifully depicted in a 15th-century fresco still adorning the interior.
Reaching this sanctuary requires climbing approximately 750 stone steps through Atrani’s labyrinthine streets, transforming the visit into a genuine pilgrimage experience.

**Important Information:** Advance booking is required to visit. Admission is free, but the church welcomes donations to support restoration and maintenance of this sacred site.

### Secret Waterfall (Valle dei Mulini)

**Short info:**
A true hidden spot behind the private villas where few tourists venture. It feels like stepping into a 'Jungle Book' scene right in Amalfi.

# Hiking & Nature
Walking routes that reveal Amalfi beyond the towns.

### Valle delle Ferriere
**Category**: Nature Reserve

Escape the heat into a lush, Jurassic-like reserve. This easy trek takes you through lemon groves and past industrial ruins to magical waterfalls.

Valle delle Ferriere is a protected nature reserve hidden in the mountains between Scala and Amalfi. The name comes from the medieval ironworks that once operated here. Today, it’s a sanctuary of rare ferns and rushing water. The hike is manageable (2-3 hours) and offers a rare shady retreat during summer.

### Torre dello Ziro
**Category**: Best View

**Short info:**
If you want that one specific shot looking straight down onto the rooftops of Atrani and Amalfi, this is it. Quiet, hauntingly beautiful, and far less crowded than Path of the Gods.

### Path of the Gods (Sentiero degli Dei)
**Category**: Hiking Trail
**Tagline**: The world-famous bucket list hike

It's touristy for a reason—the views are unmatched. My advice: Start in Bomerano and walk *down* towards Nocelle to keep the best views in front of you.

This is the most famous hiking trail on the Amalfi Coast (approx. 7km). It runs along the mountain ridges high above the sea.
*Start:* Take the SITA bus (line 5080) from Amalfi to Agerola (Bomerano stop).
*End:* The trail ends in Nocelle, a hamlet of Positano.
From Nocelle, you have two options to reach Positano: take the Mobility Amalfi Coast bus (buy ticket in local shop/onboard) or descend the ~1,700 steps to Arienzo. The scenery offers dramatic cliffs and endless sea views.

# Favourite restauraunts
From family kitchens to legendary dining rooms by the sea.

### Le Palme (Atrani)
**Category**: Family Restaurant/Pizzeria
**Tagline**: Authentic hospitality & seafood

**Short info:**
Run by brothers Armando and Salvatore since 1990, this place feels like home. It’s my top pick for a reliable, delicious meal where the service is as good as the food.

Le Palme is a highly-regarded restaurant run by two brothers, Chef Armando and Hall Master Salvatore. During peak tourist season and school holidays, Salvatore’s children lend a hand in the dining area. Since 1990, these brothers have been dedicated to winning over every guest with their impeccable service and delicious cuisine.
On the Amalfi Coast, many restaurants struggle with proper meat preparation, but Le Palme stands out. Don’t miss out on their grilled seafood, signature pistachio pesto pasta, or Fish in Crazy Water. They also offer gluten-free pasta and pizza.
The atmosphere is lively and friendly. Salvatore also manages a rental villa, striving to provide comfort. Whether dining in or taking out, the brothers are always accommodating.

### Marina di Praia (Praiano)
**Category**: Beach / Chill
**Tagline**: Sun, cliffs, and spaghetti

**Short info:**
Often cited by experienced travelers as the best "chill" spot. No glamour, just a tiny beach wedged between massive cliffs with great food right on the stones.

**The Details:**
Unlike Positano, Marina di Praia has a laid-back soul. The beach is located at the mouth of a gorge in Praiano. It is accessible by car (paid parking nearby) or SITA bus (stop "Marina di Praia"). The sun leaves early here due to the cliffs (usually by early afternoon), so it's perfect for a morning swim followed by a long, lazy lunch at one of the beachside trattorias (like Bar Mare Petit).
